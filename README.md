# RocketNotes

RocketNotes is a web application designed to help users manage and organize their notes efficiently. This project was developed using ReactJS for the frontend, Vite for fast and optimized builds, Styled Components for modular and dynamic styling, and React Icons for easy integration of scalable icons.

The development process included 5 hours of guided classes, supplemented by additional hours dedicated to implementing and refining the learned concepts. This project was a hands-on experience in applying key frontend technologies to create a functional and user-friendly note-taking application.
